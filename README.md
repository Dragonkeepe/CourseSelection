## Introduction
Hello again! This is another segment of my ongoing contributions to the Course Selection system project, focusing on enhancing user interaction and clarity throughout the application. This documentation covers the updates made within the `jaypatel` branch, my dedicated branch for these improvements.

## About the `jaypatel` Branch
The `jaypatel` branch is specifically created for my contributions aimed at refining the user interface and experience. Named to reflect my personal workspace for the project, this branch serves as the foundation for my enhancements before they are proposed for integration into the main branch.

## Recent Changes
My latest contribution on the `jaypatel` branch involves an update to the user registration feature. I made the following change in the page header within the `index.html` file:

- **Header Update**:
  From:
  ```html
  <h1>Registration</h1>
  ```
  To:
  ```html
  <h1>Register new account</h1>
  ```
  This modification aims to make the registration process more inviting and clearer to new users by explicitly stating the action of creating a new account.

## Rationale Behind the Change
The decision to update the registration page header to "Register new account" stems from user feedback indicating that a more descriptive and action-oriented heading could enhance the registration experience. By making this change, I aim to provide a more welcoming and straightforward pathway for new users joining our platform.

## Committing to User Experience
All updates I commit, including this header text change, are meticulously documented and reviewed within the `jaypatel` branch. This structured approach ensures that each enhancement is aligned with our goal of improving the overall user experience.

## Conclusion and Invitations for Feedback
This header update is a part of my broader efforts to make the Course Selection system more user-friendly and intuitive. I am deeply committed to evolving the system based on user needs and feedback.

I encourage anyone with suggestions for further improvements or comments on the current changes to reach out. Your feedback is invaluable in our collective effort to enhance the Course Selection system.
